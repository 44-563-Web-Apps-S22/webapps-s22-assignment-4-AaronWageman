    <h3>Play: Tartuffe</h3>
    <h5>Act 4 - Description: In this act, Cléante comes to speak with Tartuffe about the news around town. 
        Cléante asks Tartuffe to pardon Damis' offense and not stand in the way of familial peace. 
        Cléante speaks to Tartuffe about showing that he is a true Christian and encouraging Orgon to take his son back.</h5>
    <p>
        Orgon.  Young girls always play such religious pranks
        When their fathers hobble their lusty flanks!
        Get up!  The harder you have to work to bear it,
        The greater the virtue and the merit.
        Let this marriage mortify your senses
        And quit bothering me with your meek defenses.
Dorine.  But . . .
Orgon.        Keep quiet, and stay out of this matter.
        I completely forbid you to add to the chatter.
Cleante.  If you will allow me to offer some advice . . .
Orgon.  Brother, your advice is worth any price:
        It is thoughtful and I truly respect it,
        But I hope you don't mind if I reject it.
Elmire [to her husband].  What can I think about what you're saying
        Except that your blindness is quite dismaying!
        You must be besotted and led astray
        To refuse to believe what has happened today.
Orgon.  My dear, I only call 'em as I see 'em.
        You favor my son, that worthless young bum,
        And I think that you are afraid to condemn
        His dirty trick on this most saintly of men.
        You are, in fact, too calm to be believed;
        You ought to have seemed a bit more aggrieved.
Elmire.  When a love-sick man makes a foolish mistake
        Must we take up arms as if honor's at stake?
        And should we always respond to small slips
        With fire in our eyes and abuse on our lips?
        For myself, I laugh at these signs of lust;
        It doesn't please me at all to grow nonplussed.
        I seek wisdom tempered with charity,
        And I'm not one of those prudes whose asperity
        Is such that they fight for virtue tooth and nail,
        And scratch a man's eyes out for being male.
        Heaven preserve me from that kind of virtue!
        I am an honest wife, but not a shrew,
        And I believe that a calm, icy glance
        Is quite enough to rebuff an advance.
Orgon.  I know what I know and I won't change my mind.
